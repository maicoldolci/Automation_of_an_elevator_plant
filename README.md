# Automation_of_an_elevator_plant
Programming an Elevator plant with PLC.

The repository is composed by 3 different folders.
In each folder is contained a project.
Every project is coded through the IDE called CODESYS with structured text (ST).

The project was texted on a didactic elevator (Didactic lift ASC89).
The programmable logic controller module (PLC) used was an ABB module DC532 and its IN/OUT can be set up through its specific software (CP400 Soft)

There is a pdf file (Report_Elevator_Group_7.pdf) that explains the whole project.
